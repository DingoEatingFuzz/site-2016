        <p>A simple web app for tracking bouldering workouts. It focuses on quickly marking which problems were completed and which were attempted. In this way, at the end of the workout, a histogram and tally of problems and problem difficulties is plotted.</p>

        <p>The NPR Music We Love app was a wonderful things, but it had no way to pin/favorite/star/save the tracks you liked. This was solvable in many ways, but the way that sounded the most interesting at the time was bookmarklets. With a click of a bookmarklet, the track would be saved to localstorage. I went overboard and created additional bookmarklets for seeing the track list and for disliking tracks. You know, just for fun.</p>
